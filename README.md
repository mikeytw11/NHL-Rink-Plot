<h1> NHL-Rink-Plot </h1>

<p> The following functions create different plots of NHL rinks to be used with play-by-play data. </p>

The credit for the enclosed files is owed to Bill Tran of The Win Column, who did the
heavy lifting to create a detailed plot of an NHL rink according to the true dimensions.
A more extensive explanation, courtesy of him, is available at the link
<a href="https://thewincolumn.ca/2021/01/15/r-tutorial-creating-an-nhl-rink-using-the-tidyverse/">here</a>
detailing some of his process creating the plot using tidyverse and ggplot.
Modifications were made of his original plot ("nhl_rink.r") to create a vertical plot
("nhl_rink_vertical.r") as well as vertical half rink plots ("nhl_rink_vertical_half_upper.r" and 
nhl_rink_vertical_half_upper.r). Feel free to make any modifications you wish to utilize the
plot(s) for your own analysis.
