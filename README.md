<h1> NHL-Rink-Plot </h1>

<p> The following functions create different plots of NHL rinks to be used with play-by-play data. </p>

The credit for the enclosed files is owed to Bill Tran of The Win Column who did a tremendous
job creating a detailed plot of the NHL rink according to the true dimensions.
A more extensive explanation of his process, detailing steps using tidyverse and ggplot can be found
<a href="https://thewincolumn.ca/2021/01/15/r-tutorial-creating-an-nhl-rink-using-the-tidyverse/">here</a>.
Modifications of his original plot ("nhl_rink.r") were made to create a vertical plot
("nhl_rink_vertical.r") as well as vertical half rink plots ("nhl_rink_vertical_half_upper.r" and 
"nhl_rink_vertical_half_upper.r"). Feel free to make any modifications you wish to utilize the
plot(s) for your own analysis.
